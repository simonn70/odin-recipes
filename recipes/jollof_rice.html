    <h1>jollof rice with vegetables</h1>
    <h3>Ghanaian's most delicious delicacy</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <h1>ingredients</h1>
        <li>100 ml vegetable oil</li>
        <li>white onions (roughly chopped)</li>
        <li>500 g passata</li>
        <li>3 chicken stock cubes</li>
        <li>Salt (to your preference)</li>
        <li>3 cups white jasmine rice (rinsed)</li>
        <li>3 1/2 cups of water</li>
        <li>2 tsp curry powder</li>
        <h1>steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Add your 2 chopped onions and 20ml of your vegetable oil to your blender and blitz until your onions are a smooth puree</li>
            <li>Heat the rest of your oil (80ml) in your pan and add your onion puree. Stir it a little then leave it on the lowest heat to turn golden. It will take about 5 minutes but keep an eye on it so it doesn't burn</li>
            <li>Whilst your onions are caramelising add the rest of your ingredients to your blender (you don't need to rinse it) and blitz until you have a smooth sauce</li>
            <li>When your onions have turned a nice golden brown (see the video below) give them a stir then add your tomato sauce. Give everything a good mix then leave it to simmer on the lowest heat for 20 minutes. Make sure to stir your sauce every 5 minutes when the oil rises to the top. This is to stop your sauce sticking to the bottom of your pan</li>
            <li>Add your 2 1/2 cups of rinsed basmati rice to your stew and stir it in well so all your rice grains are covered</li>
            <li>Add in 2 1/2 cups of water and stir everything well. Then cover your pan with some foil and then the pan lid and leave it to simmer on a low heat for 30 minutes</li>
            <li>When your rice is cooked fluff it up with a fork</li>
            <li>Now it's time to enjoy, so dig in (",)</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>
